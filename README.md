# Around The U.S

This is the eighth project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on the Figma design. It's a responsive interface that adapts to 3 different screen sizes and allows users to add more text and upload more pictures to their gallery. Section, Modal, ModalWithForm, ModalWithImage and UserInfo classes were implemented using advanced object-oriented programming concepts learned in this sprint.

## Project features

- Responsive Design
- Grid Layout
- Media Queries
- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Flat BEM file structure
- JavaScript

## Plan on improving the project

- To add smooth transitions to the add button's border size at the different breakpoints using the transform scale property.
- To add more interactivity and expand user features upon acquiring the new JavaScript skills from the next sprint.
